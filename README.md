# Software-Test-Automation

Incorporating software automation into the development of software has come to be one of the most efficient and effective ways to ensure code is functional and secure. Additionally, the use of automation saves time and effort by cutting down on the manual labor needed for completing repetitive tasks or testing. Thoroughly following the rubric to ensure all requirements are met is another way to make certain that a software will be funtional and implementing security protection such as passwords and 2-step authentication will ensure security. When creating any program, it is important to take into consideration the needs of the client. The clients requirements should be discussed during the planning phase where it is then discussed with the team how the these requirements will be incoporapted into the final software. For big projects, it is crucial that the team be flexible in the case that the users' requirements are changed during the development phase. My approach to designing software is to first thoroughly review the requirements, then divide the workload into segments. I find it best to breakdown my workload into segments instead of overwhelming myself with the entire project at once. Following these two main steps build the foundation to creating a good, quality software.
